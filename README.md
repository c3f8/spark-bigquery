# spark-bigquery

This project provides a Google BigQuery data source (`com.miraisolutions.spark.bigquery.DefaultSource`) to Spark on top of [Spotify's spark-bigquery library](https://github.com/spotify/spark-bigquery).

This data source is used in the [sparkbq](https://github.com/miraisolutions/sparkbq) R package.

## Building

Due to dependency version mismatches between Apache Spark and Google client libraries (e.g. Google Guava) this project uses [`sbt-assembly`](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly) to build a fat JAR using [shading](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly#shading) to relocate relevant Google classes.

ProGuard may be used via the [`sbt-proguard`](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-proguard) plugin to further shrink the assembly size. Simply run `sbt proguard` to perform that step. The resulting JAR file can be found in the `target/proguard` folder.

## Example

The provided Google BigQuery data source (`com.miraisolutions.spark.bigquery.DefaultSource`) can be used as follows:

``` scala
val df = spark.read
    .format("com.miraisolutions.spark.bigquery")
    .option("bq.project.id", "<your_billing_project_id>")
    .option("bq.gcs.bucket", "<your_gcs_bucket>")
    .option("table", "bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare")
    .load()
```

You can find a complete example at `com.miraisolutions.spark.bigquery.examples.Shakespeare`.

To run this example on Google Dataproc (assuming you have the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) installed):
1. Build an assembly using `sbt clean compile assembly`
2. `gcloud dataproc jobs submit spark --cluster <your_cluster_name> --class com.miraisolutions.spark.bigquery.examples.Shakespeare --jars target/scala-2.11/spark-bigquery-assembly-<version>.jar -- <your_billing_project_id> <your_gcs_bucket>`

If you are running on a Spark cluster outside of the Google Cloud, you may need to set [Google application default credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials) or relevant Spark/Hadoop configuration options. The following is an example using a local Spark cluster:

`spark-submit --class com.miraisolutions.spark.bigquery.examples.Shakespeare --master local[2] --conf spark.hadoop.google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile="/path/to/your/gcp_json_keyfile.json" target/scala-2.11/spark-bigquery-assembly-<version>.jar <your_billing_project_id> <your_gcs_bucket>`
