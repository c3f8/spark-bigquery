# spark-bigquery

This project provides a Spark data source (`com.miraisolutions.spark.bigquery.DefaultSource`) for Google BigQuery on top of [Spotify's spark-bigquery library](https://github.com/spotify/spark-bigquery).

This data source is used in the [sparkbq](https://github.com/miraisolutions/sparkbq) R package.

## Building

Due to dependency version mismatches between Apache Spark and Google client libraries (e.g. Google Guava) this project uses [`sbt-assembly`](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly) to build a fat JAR using [shading](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly#shading) to relocate relevant Google classes.

ProGuard may be used via the [`sbt-proguard`](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-proguard) plugin to further shrink the assembly size. Simply run `sbt proguard` to perform that step. The resulting JAR file can be found in the `target/proguard` folder.
